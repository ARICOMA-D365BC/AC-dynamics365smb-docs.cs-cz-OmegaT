# Intelligent Insights with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

As a user of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you have full access to scenarios that are based on the intelligent cloud, such as KPIs that are based on machine learning, or when you view your data in Power BI.

However, if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, you do not have access to the same insights. If you want to benefit from online scenarios, you must migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, see [Migrating On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-data) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Viewing Insights in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Online

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Intelligent Cloud Insights** page shows four key points of interest for most businesses:

- Dostupnost hotovosti
- Ziskovost prodeje
- Čistý zisk
- Hodnota zásob

Vedle grafů KPI získáte přehled o potenciálních oblastech zájmu, včetně plateb po splatnosti. Zvolte si přehled, který vám umožní zkoumat data.
