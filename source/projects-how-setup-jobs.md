# Set Up Jobs, Prices, and Job Posting Groups

As a project manager, you can set up jobs that define each of the projects that you manage in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the **Jobs Setup** page, you must specify how you want to use certain job features.

For each job, you then specify individual job cards with information about prices for job items, job resources, and job G/L accounts, and you must set up job posting groups.

## To set general information for jobs
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Jobs Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The **Apply Usage Link by Default** field indicates if job ledger entries are linked to job planning lines by default. Choose the field if you want to apply this setting to all new jobs that you create. You can enable or disable job usage tracking for a specific job by changing value of the **Apply Usage Link** field on the individual job card. The consequenses are explained in the following section.

### To set up job usage tracking

When you are working on a job, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To easily do this, you can create a link between your job planning lines and the actual usage. This lets you track your costs and to easily see at how much work remains to be done. By default, the job planning line type is *Budget*, but using the line type **Both Budget and Billable** has similar effects.

After you have set up usage tracking by choosing the **Apply Usage Link** field, you can review information on the job planning line. You can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account, and then indicate what quantity you want to transfer to the job journal. The **Remaining Quantity** field on the job planning line will tell you what remains to be transferred and posted to the job journal.

>[!NOTE]
> If the **Apply Usage Link** is chosen on the individual job, and the **Line Type** field on the job journal line or purchase line is *Billable*, then new job planning lines of line type *Budget* are created when you post job journal or purchase document.  
> For more information, see [Record Usage for Jobs](projects-how-record-job-usage.md) and [Manage Job Supplies](projects-how-manage-project-supplies.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the **Line Type** field on the job journal line or purchase line is blank, then no job planning lines are created when you post the job journal or purchase document.

<!--
>[!Important]
If job usage tracking is enabled on the individual job and the **Line Type** field on the job journal or purchase line line is blank, then new job planning lines of line type *Budget* are created when you post job journal or purchase document.
If job usage tracking is not enabled and the **Line Type** field on the job journal line or purchase line is blank, then no job planning lines are created when you post job journal or purchase document.

## To set up prices for resources, items, and general ledger accounts for jobs
> [!NOTE]
> In 2020 release wave 2, we released new processes for setting up and managing prices and discounts. If you're a new customer, you're using the new experience. If you're an existing customer, whether you are using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **New sales pricing experience** feature update in **Feature Management**. For more information, see [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/feature-management).

You can set up prices for the items, resources, and general ledger accounts related to a job. 

#### [Current Experience](#tab/current-experience)
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Jobs**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the job, and then choose the **Resource**, **Item**, or **G/L Account** action.
3. On the **Job Resource Prices**, **Job Item Prices**, or **Job G/L Account Prices** pages, fill in the fields as necessary.

The following table shows how the information in the optional fields will be used on job planning lines and journals when the resource, item, or general ledger account are chosen for the job.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|---------|---------|
|**Job Resources**|The **Job Task No.**, **Work Type**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, and **Unit Cost Factor** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the resource will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this resource, a resource assigned to the resource group, or any resource is entered. Note that this price will always override any prices set up in the existing **Resource Price/Resource Group Prices** page.|
|**Job Items**|The **Job Task No.**, **Currency Code**, and **Line Discount %** fields. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the item will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this item is entered. Note that this price will always override the regular customer price (the "best price" mechanism) for items. If you want to use the regular customer price mechanisms, then you should not create any job item prices for the job.|
|**General Ledger Accounts**|The information in the **Job Task No.**, **Currency Code**, **Line Discount %**, **Unit Cost Factor**, and **Unit Cost** fields will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a job. The value in the **Unit Price** field for the general ledger job expense will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this general ledger account is entered.|

## To set up job posting groups
One aspect of planning jobs is deciding which posting accounts to use for job costing. To be able to post jobs, you set up accounts for posting for each job posting group. A posting group represents a link between the job and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a job, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the job is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   The necessary accounts in the chart of accounts must be set up before you set up posting groups. For more information, see [Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts](finance-setup-chart-accounts.md).  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Job Posting Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action, and then fill in the account fields as described in the following table.  

| Account field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Code** |A code for the posting group. You can enter up to 10 characters, including spaces. |
