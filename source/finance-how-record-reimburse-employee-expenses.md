# Record and Reimburse Employees' Expenses

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports transactions for employee in a similar way as for vendors. Accordingly, employee posting groups exist to make sure that employee ledger entries are posted to the relevant accounts in the general ledger.

> [!NOTE]  
> Employee transactions can be posted in the local currency only. Reimbursement payments to employees do not support discounts and payment tolerances.

If employees spend their own money during business activities, you can post the expense to the employee's account. Then you can reimburse the employee by making a payment to the employee's bank account, similarly to how you pay vendors.  

> [!TIP]
> This article explains how to record the expense in the books and how to reimburse the employee. Your organization may have a portal or app where employees can submit their expense reports.

## To record an employee's expense
You post employees' expenses on the **General Journal** page.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant general journal batch. For more information, see [Working with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. On a new journal line, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]    

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE[journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip](includes/journal-showhide-columns-inline-tip.md)]
4. Repeat step 3 for all the expenses that the employee has incurred.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If you want to enter multiple expense lines above one balance-account line for the employee's bank account, then select the **Suggest Balancing Amount** check box on the line for your batch on the **General Journal Batches** page. Then the **Amount** field on the balance-account line is automatically prefilled with the value that is required to balance the expenses.
5. Choose the **Post** action to record the expenses on the employee's account.

## To reimburse an employee
You reimburse employees by posting payments to their bank account on the **Payment Journal** page.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Payment Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant payment journal batch. For more information, see [Working with General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. For more information, see [Making Payments](payables-make-payments.md).
4. Alternatively, choose the **Suggest Employee Payment** action to automatically insert journal lines for pending employee reimbursements.
5. Choose the **Post** action to register the reimbursement.  

## To reconcile reimbursements with employee ledger entries
You apply employee payments to their related open employee ledger entries in the same way as you do for vendor payments, for example on the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, based on the related bank statement entries. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md). Alternatively, you can apply manually on the **Employee Ledger Entries** page. For more information, see the related [Reconcile Vendor Payments with the Payment Journal or from Vendor Ledger Entries](payables-how-apply-purchase-transactions-manually.md).
