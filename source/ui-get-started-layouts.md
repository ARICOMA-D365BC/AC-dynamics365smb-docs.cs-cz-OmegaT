# Get Started Creating Report Layouts

Business Central comes with many built-in layouts that you can use on your reports. Other layouts may have been added as part of other extensions. But it's also possible to create your own reports either from scratch or based an existing layout.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can also use report layouts to add content to email messages. For example, report layouts can save time and help ensure consistency by reusing the same content when you communicate with your customers. To use custom report layouts with email, the file type for the layout must be Word. You cannot use the RDLC file type. For more information, see [Set Up Reusable Email Texts and Layouts](admin-how-setup-email.md#set-up-reusable-email-texts-and-layouts). 

## Overview

When working with report layouts, it helps to think of the layout as a file that's imported and assigned to a report. Regardless of the layout type, how you manage layouts in Business Central is basically the same. Usually, you'll work from the **Report Layouts** page. The main difference is how you design the layout, which is done by using the application software that the layout's built on, like Word, Excel, or SQL Server Report Builder.

With this concept in mind. there are basically three or four tasks involved in setting up a layout on a report:

1. Decide on the layout type.
2. Export a copy of an existing layout to use as a starting point.
3. Make changes to the layout file in the appropriate application.
4. Add the new layout file to the report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't modify or replace an extension layout, which is a layout that originates from an extension. You can only modify or replace user-defined layouts. On the **Report Layouts** page, you can tell whether layout is an extension layout or user-defined layout by looking at **Extension** column. An extension layout will show information about the source extension in the column. The **Extension** column will be empty for a user-defined layout.

## Get started

Depending on what your situation is, the actual tasks will vary. Use the following table to help you get started.

## <a name="decide"></a>Decide what type of layout you want

The first thing when creating a layout is to decide which [layout type](ui-manage-report-layouts.md#layout-types) you want. You can choose either Word, Excel, or RDLC. The layout type will depend on how you want the generated report to look. Plus, it depends on your knowledge of application software for creating the layouts, like Word, Excel, and SQL Server Report Builder.

<!--
* The process for setting up Word, Excel, and RDLC layouts on reports is the same. The main difference is in the way you modify the layouts. Excel and Word layouts are typically easier to create and modify than RDLC layouts because you use Word and Excel. RDLC report layouts are modified by using SQL Server Report builder, which targets more advanced users.-->

* Excel layouts are generally the easiest to create and modify because the features for summarizing data, adding graphics, and styling, are common Excel features.

* Not all reports and document have a dataset that is optimized for use with an Excel layout. For example, aggregations and complex calculations work best with RDLC or Word layouts. The same is true for documents.

* If you're only making style changes like font type, size and colors, a Word layout are also a good choice.

* Adding data fields or rearranging data fields in Word or RDLC is more advanced than with Excel.

* Word and RDLC layouts are good to use for reports that will eventually be printed.  

* The general design concepts for Word and RDLC layouts are similar. However each type has certain design features that affect how the generated report appears in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The same report might look different when using the Word layout compared to the RDLC layout.

## <a name="create"></a>Create a new layout

There are two ways to create a new layout from an existing layout. One way is by saving the existing layout to a copy. The other way is to export the existing layout.

## [Copying](#tab/copy)

Copying is a quick way to create a new layout that's the same as an existing layout. Once you have the copy, you'll make modifications by exporting the layout. 

[!INCLUDE[open-report-layouts-page](includes/open-report-layouts-page.md)]
2. Select the layout that you want a copy of for your new layout, then choose the **Edit Info** action.

    If you selected an extension layout, you're prompted whether you want to edit a copy. To continue, select **Yes**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To help you find the layout, use the **Search** box, **Filter** pane, and columns sorting.
3. Change the **Layout Name**.
4. Turn the **Save Changes to Copy** switch to **On**, then select **OK**

   The new layout shows in the **Report Layouts** page.
5. If you want to make changes to the new layout, see [Modify an existing layout](#modify).

### [Exporting/Importing](#tab/export)

   The layout file is downloaded to your device. 

    > [!TIP]

   For more information, see:

   * [Work with Word Layouts](ui-how-add-fields-word-report-layout.md)
   * [Work with Excel Layouts](ui-excel-report-layouts.md)
   * [Work with RDLC Layouts](ui-rdlc-report-layouts.md)

   Make changes to the file and save it.

4. Back on the **Report Layouts**, select the **New Layout** action.
5. Fill in the following fields:

   |Field|Description|Mandatory|
   |-----|-----------|---------|
   |Report ID|Set to the ID assigned to the report|yes|
   |Layout Name| Type a brief description name for the layout to help you easily identify it.|yes|
   |Description| Type more detailed information the layout. |no|
   |Format Options|Set this field to match the type of the layout, like Word, Excel, or RDLC.|yes|

6. Select **OK** > **Choose** to open file explorer on your device.
7. Find and select the Excel file, then select **Open**.

   The selected file is uploaded to the layout, and you return to the **Report Layouts** page.
