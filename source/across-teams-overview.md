# Business Central and Microsoft Teams Integration

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams) is a Microsoft 365 product that lets you connect with others, collaborate seamlessly, and simplify work. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers an app that connects Microsoft Teams to your business data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so you can quickly share details across team members and respond faster to inquiries.

## Overview

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app lets you:

- Copy a link to any Business Central record and paste it into a Teams conversation to share with your coworkers. The app will then expand the link into a compact, interactive card that displays information about the record.
- Once in the conversation, you and coworkers can view more details about the record, edit data, and take action - without leaving Teams.

The app is available on the Teams marketplace, and you can use it with the Teams web, desktop, or mobile app.
