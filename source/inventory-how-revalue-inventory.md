# Revalue Inventory
If you want to appreciate or depreciate an item or a specific item ledger entry, you must use the revaluation journal.

## To revalue inventory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Revaluation Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Calculate Inventory Value** action.
3. On the **Calculate Inventory Value** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **OK** button.
5. On each line on the **Revaluation Journal** page, in the **Unit Cost (Revalued)** field, enter the new unit cost. Alternatively, enter the new total amount in the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.

    The relevant fields are automatically updated. Note that the **Amount** field shows the actual change in inventory value for the selected item ledger entry. It calculates the difference between the **Inventory Value (Calculated)** field and the **Inventory Value (Revalued)** field.
6. When you have completed all lines in the revaluation journal, choose the **Post** action.

New value entries are now created to reflect the revaluations that you have posted. You can see the new values on the respective item cards.
