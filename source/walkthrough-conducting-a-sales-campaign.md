# Walkthrough Conducting a Sales Campaign

A campaign is any kind of activity that involves several contacts. An important part of setting up a campaign involves selecting the target audience for your campaign. For this purpose, in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you create a segment, or a group of contacts using filters.  

 You use these features in Sales & Marketing to carefully plan your marketing activities and to manage your interactions with contacts and customers. You can create campaigns and set up segments of your contacts for mailings and other types of interactions with your contacts and prospective customers.  

 The Campaign and Segment features with their automated processes enable you to plan, organize, and keep track of your marketing activities. This will increase the chances of winning new customers and retaining existing customers.  

## About This Walkthrough

## Prerequisites

## Story

 The marketing manager in the Sales department of CRONUS is responsible for planning campaigns and for executing them. He also makes decisions about which trade shows to participate in and he evaluates campaign progress.  

 The marketing staffer in the Marketing department handles producing, distributing, and placing marketing material.  

 The company has just launched a new product called the Rome Guest Chair. The product was recently promoted at a trade show, Office Futurus. Many customers expressed great interest in the product, and as part of a promotional effort, customers who bought Rome Guest Chair during a campaign period were offered a special campaign price.  

 One of the marketing staffer’s tasks after the trade show is to enter all the potential customers as contacts.  

 The marketing manager sets up a campaign, creates a segment that contains all the new contacts and then mines the contact data to select the target audience for the campaign.  

 The staffer helps send out thank you letters to all the contacts who left their cards with the staff at the stand, and finally, the manager records all the responses they receive from the prospective customers.  

## Setting Up a Campaign

 As soon as the staffer has entered the business cards received at the trade show, the marketing manager sets up a campaign card to manage the activities involved in the campaign.  

### To set up a campaign  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Campaigns**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new campaign. On the campaign card, press **Enter** to have a campaign number automatically inserted.  
3. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the campaign, for example, **Office Futurus trade show**.  
4. Choose the **Status Code** field, and select the status code "1-PLAN". 
5. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields of the campaign as appropriate.  

## Selecting the Target Audience

 The marketing manager creates a segment to select the contacts that they want to interact with.  
 
 When you create a segment, you can use a variety of criteria to select the contacts that must be targets for the segment. For example, you can select contact persons who work at a customer site or a prospective customer site who are responsible for purchases at their company. You use filters to add contacts according to the criteria that best fit your purposes. For example, you can choose to filter by the job responsibility of the contact person or the business relation or industry of the contact company. For this walkthrough, we'll choose the **Job Responsibility** filter to select contacts.

### To create a segment with the relevant contacts  

1. Choose the **Navigate** action, and then choose **Segments**.  
2. Choose the **New** action to create a new segment. On the segment card, select **Enter** to have a segment number automatically inserted.  
3. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Description** field, enter, for example, *Visitors at the Office Futurus trade show*.
4. Choose the **Add Contacts** action to open the **Add Contacts** filter.  
5. Scroll down to the **Contact Job Responsibility** FastTab, select the **Purchase** filter as the **Job Responsibility Code** and choose the **OK** button.  

The **Segment** page now contains a list of contacts based on the filter you entered. On the **General** FastTab, in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see at a glance the number of contacts that meet these criteria.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can save your segmentation criteria to be reused at a later stage.

### To save your segmentation criteria

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. Choose **Functions**, then **Segment**, and then choose the **Save Criteria** action.  
3. On the **Save Segment Criteria** page, enter a code for the segment. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the segment criteria.
4. Choose the **OK** button.  

## Mining the Data

 The marketing manager takes a closer look at the segmented list of contacts and realizes that the list is much too big. He decides to reduce the list based on actual, prospective customers to make sure he focuses on the correct target group. This process of refining and reducing the data is also referred to as data mining.  

### To remove contacts from the segment  

1. On the **Segment** page, choose **Actions**.
2. In the menu bar below, choose **Functions**, choose **Contacts**, and the choose **Reduce Contacts**.  

  This opens the **Remove Contacts – Reduce** dialog.  
4. On the **Contact Business Relation** FastTab, select the **CUST** filter as the **Business Relation Code**, and choose the **OK** button.

 The **Segment** page now contains a reduced list of contacts, and in the **No. of Lines** field, you can see the number of contacts that now meet these new criteria.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 > If you have to reverse this removal of a group of contacts, you can do this using the **Go Back** function. In other words, you can undo your last segmentation.  

### To bring back the removed contacts

1. On the **Segment** page, choose the **Segment** action.
2. Choose the **Go Back** action.

The contacts that you just removed are added back to the list of contacts.

## Linking a Segment to a Campaign

The marketing manager decides that the reduced list is the final list of contacts that they want to be part of the campaign. They therefore link this segment to the campaign FUTURUS trade show.  

### To link a segment to the campaign  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Campaign** FastTab, choose the **Campaign No.** field to select the campaign that you want the segment to be attached to, for example, **CP0001**.
2. Select **Yes**.  
3. Since this segment is the target of the campaign, select the **Campaign Target** check box and choose **Yes**.  

## Sending Letters and Email Messages to Contacts

 The marketing staffer helps the marketing manager send out correspondence to the prospective customers, in which they thank them for visiting the trade show.

### To use a segment to send a letter to a contact  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this procedure you have to attach a Word document. You can add attachments in any language.

The attachments are sent. When the process is done, choose the **OK** button for the message that states that the segment has been logged.  

 The letters are automatically printed and the segment is logged. Because the segment has been logged, it is no longer in the list of segments but is moved to the list of logged segments. To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

After the segment is logged, each letter that is sent is recorded as an interaction, which you can view in the log.

To see that list, Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Logged Segments**, and then choose the related link.  

## Registering Campaign Responses

 During the next couple of weeks, the prospective customers respond to the letter. The marketing manager wants to keep track of the responses and record these interactions.  

 For this purpose, set up a segment for the contacts who have responded to the letter.  

### To register campaign responses  

1. On the **Segment** page, on the **Interaction** FastTab, choose the **Interaction Template Code** field.
