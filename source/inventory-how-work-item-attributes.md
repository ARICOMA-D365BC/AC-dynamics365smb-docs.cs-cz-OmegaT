# Work with Item Attributes
When customers inquire about an item, either in correspondence or in an integrated web shop, they may ask or search according to characteristics, such as height and model year. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which can then be used when searching for items.

You can also assign item attributes to item categories, which then apply to the items that use the item categories. For more information, see [Categorize Item](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

> [!Tip]  
> If you attach pictures to items, the Image Analyzer extension can detect attributes in the image, and suggest the attributes so you can decide whether to assign them. The extension is ready to go. You just need to enable it. For more information, see [The Image Analyzer Extension](ui-extensions-image-analyzer.md).

## To create item attributes
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Item Attributes**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Item Attributes** page, choose the **New** action.
3. On the **Item Attribute** page, fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
>   If you select **Option** in the **Type** field, then you can choose the **Item Attribute Values** action to create values for the item attribute. For more information, see [To create values for item attributes of type Option](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md#to-create-values-for-item-attributes-of-type-option).

## To filter by item attributes

4. In the **Value** field, choose the lookup button and select an attribute value to filter items by.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >   You can only select values directly for item attributes that have fixed values, such as Color. For item attributes that have variable values, such as Width, you must specify the item attribute value by first selecting a condition. See step 5.
5. In the **Value** field for a variable item attribute, choose the lookup button.
6. On the **Specify Filter Value** page, in the **Condition** field, choose the drop-down arrow and select a condition.

8. Choose the **OK** button.   

The items on the **Items** page are filtered by the specified item attribute values.
