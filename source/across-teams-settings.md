# Changing Company and Other Settings in Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams includes a **Settings** page that lets you view and change information about your connection to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, you switch the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment and company you're connected to. You can also see which account you're using to access [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and sign out and in again as needed.

There are two ways to open the **Settings** page: 1) from the message compose box or 2) from the command box.

1. Beneath the message compose box, right-click the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app icon, then select **Settings**.
