# Business Central for Multi-Site and International Organizations
Organizations that have multiple sites often use a hub-and-spoke business model where a parent company, or headquarters, manages the overall operations of the business while each site functions as a single, standalone entity. Sites are often geographically distributed and have different needs for sharing information with the headquarter company. Additionally, sites typically don't need the same level of complexity, and often lack the resources to maintain a large system.

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] gives small and mid-sized businesses a business management solution that's easy-to-use and maintain at a low cost of ownership.

This article introduces some of the ways in which [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports a hub-and-spoke business model.

## Integrating the Headquarter Company and the Sites

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can integrate with the headquarter company's accounting system while meeting the varying needs of different sites, regardless of size, location, or type of business.

The following diagram is an example of different sites integrated with a headquarter company.

## Meet the Needs of Domestic and International Sites

Business needs at sites often differ based on industry, business methods, or their relationship to the headquarter company. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can be easily adapted and extended for various types of businesses and locales. Microsoft AppSource offers a wealth of apps from Microsoft and our partners, and partners can quickly deploy [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with minimal disruption to daily operations.

For multi-national organizations, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports local legal requirements and business practices.

* For online versions, there are more than [40 localized country versions](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json) that you can install as extensions from Microsoft AppSource.  
* For on-premises versions, [country versions](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/business-central) are available either as Microsoft-localized versions or partner-led add-on localizations.

A network of more than 4,000 Microsoft partners world-wide provides local expertise.

## Consolidate Financial Data

A core facet of the hub-and-spoke business model is the ability for the headquarter company and sites to exchange financial data, even when the headquarter company and sites use different systems, accounting structures, languages, and currencies.

| **Business requirement** | **How Business Central supports it** | **Learn more** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Connect customized versions among sites and the headquarter company. | API Pages can expose any representation of an entity, including its customizations. | [Enabling APIs for Business Central](/dynamics-nav/enabling-apis-for-dynamics-nav) |
| Versioning and security. | APIs use ODataV4, which provides versioning, and webhooks and change tracking. | [Security and protection](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/security/security-and-protection) |
| Post and import XML documents. | Codeunits can be exposed as unbound actions to support posting and ingestion of XML documents. For processing XML documents, XMLports can be applied. Unbound actions are also capable of generating an XML or JSON document. | [XMLport Objects](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-xmlport-object) |
| Make maintenance easier through electronic data exchange. | An electronic data exchange solution can be added to serve as an integration layer between the headquarter company and sites. | [Data Exchange Framework](across-about-the-data-exchange-framework.md) |

## Promote an Efficient Intercompany Supply Chain

Sites often need access to the supply chain, and the ability to manage certain aspects of it. For example, sites might use the same vendor, but manage their assets and physical locations separately.

|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Treat inter-divisional transactions as normal sales and purchase transactions. | Use inter-company postings to create sales and purchase documents and general ledger entries for entire workflows, and for more than one company at a time to eliminate duplicate data entry. | [Managing Inter-company Transactions](intercompany-manage.md) |
| Use paperless processes. | Avoid the cost of sending, receiving, and printing documents. | [Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md)<br><br> [Manage Attachments, Links, and Notes on Cards and Documents](ui-how-add-link-to-record.md) |

## Respond Quickly to New Business Conditions

The headquarter company must be able to react quickly to business changes at each site. Combined with Power Automate, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can serve as an early warning mechanism.
