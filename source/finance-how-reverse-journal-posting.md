# Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments
To undo an erroneous journal posting, you select the entry and create a reverse entry (entries identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field) with the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After reversing an entry, you must make the correct entry.

You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed once.

To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they are posted as invoiced, you can use the **Undo** function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type **Item** and **Resource**.

If you have made an incorrect negative quantity posting, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, and posted it as received but not invoiced, then you can undo the posting.

If you have made an incorrect positive quantity posting, such as a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items, and posted it as shipped but not invoiced, then you can undo the posting.   

## To reverse the journal posting of a general ledger entry
You can reverse entries from all **Ledger Entries** pages. The following procedure is based on the **General Ledger Entries** page.
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Entries**, and then choose the related link.

4. Choose the **Yes** button on the confirmation message.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot reverse entries that have been posted with information from a job, or which have realized gains and losses within the same transaction.

## To post a negative entry  
You can use the **Correction** field to post a negative debit instead of a credit, or to post a negative credit instead of a debit on an account. To meet legal requirements, this field is visible by default in all journals. The **Debit Amount** and **Credit Amount** fields include both the original entry, and the corrected entry. These fields have no effect on the account balance.  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link  
2.  In the **Batch Name** field, select the required batch name.  
3.  Enter information into the relevant fields.  
4.  In the journal line that you want to activate for negative entries, select the **Correction** check box.  
5.  To post the journal, choose the **Post** action, and then choose the **Yes** button.
