# Specify Posting Periods
Use posting periods to specify when users can post to the general ledger.  

## To specify posting periods
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General Ledger Setup** page, define the period by entering dates in the **Allow Posting From** and **Allow Posting To** fields.  

> [!NOTE]  
>   These posting periods apply to the company and to all users. To allow for exceptions, you can define different posting periods for specific users on the **User Setup** page. These posting periods overrule those specified on the **General Ledger Setup** page. For more information, see [To set up user time constraints](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-set-up-user-time-constraints).
