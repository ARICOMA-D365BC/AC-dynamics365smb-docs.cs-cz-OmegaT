# Warehouse Management
After goods are received and before goods are shipped, a series of internal warehouse activities take place to ensure an effective flow through the warehouse and to organize and maintain company inventories.

Typical warehouse activities include putting items away, moving items inside or between warehouses, and picking items for assembly, production, or shipment. Assembling items for sale or inventory may also be considered warehouse activities, but these are covered elsewhere. For more information, see [Assembly Management](assembly-assemble-items.md).  

In large warehouses, these different handling tasks can be separated by departments and the integration managed by a directed workflow. In simpler installations, the flow is less formalized and the warehouse activities are performed with so-called inventory put-aways and inventory picks. For more information about basic versus advanced warehouse configurations, see [Design Details: Warehouse Overview](design-details-warehouse-overview.md).

Before you can perform warehouse activities, you must set the system up for the relevant complexity of warehouse processing. For more information, see [Setting Up Warehouse Management](warehouse-setup-warehouse.md).

The inventory-related tasks of counting, adjusting, and reclassifying items may involve warehouse tasks that must be performed on warehouse entries before they can be synchronized with the related item ledger entries. For more information, see [Count, Adjust, and Reclassify Inventory](inventory-how-count-adjust-reclassify.md).

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.   

|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|Record the receipt (including over-receipt) of items at warehouse locations, either with a purchase order only, in simple location setups, or with a warehouse receipt, in case of semi or fully automated warehouse processing at the location.|[Receive Items](warehouse-how-receive-items.md)|
|Bypass the put-away and pick processes to expedite an item straight from receiving or production to shipping.|[Cross-Dock Items](warehouse-how-to-cross-dock-items.md)|    
|Put away items received from purchases, sales returns, transfers, or production output according to the configured warehouse process.|[Putting Items Away](warehouse-put-away-items.md)|
|Move items between bins in the warehouse.|[Moving Items](warehouse-move-items.md)|
|Pick items to be shipped, transferred, or consumed in assembly or production, according to the configured warehouse process.|[Picking Items](warehouse-pick-items.md)|
|Record the shipment of items from warehouse locations, either with a sales order only, in simple location setups, or with a warehouse shipment, in case of semi or fully automated warehouse processes at the location.|[Ship Items](warehouse-how-ship-items.md)|
