    title: Workflow Notifications
    description: Many workflow responses are about notifying a user that an event has occurred that they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a related processing of the approved record. For workflow steps that are about approval, each notification is tied to an approval entry.

# Workflow Notifications

Set up your workflows to automatically notify users when their attention is required for a step in that workflow. Many workflow responses are about notifying a user that an event has occurred that they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a related processing of the approved record. For workflow steps that are about approval, each notification is tied to an approval entry. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports notifications as email and as internal notes.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All workflow notifications are sent through a job queue. Make sure that the job queue in your installation is set up to handle workflow notifications, and that the **Start Automatically From Server** check box is selected. For more information, see [Use Job Queues to Schedule Tasks](admin-job-queues-schedule-tasks.md).

## Set up notifications

You set up different aspects of workflow notifications in the following places:  

* Approver notification

    For approval workflows, you set up the recipients of workflow notifications by filling a line on the **Approval User Setup** page for each user that takes part in the workflow.  

    For example, if User 2 is specified in the **Approver ID** field on the line for User 1, then the approval request notification is sent to User 1. For more information, see [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  
* Notification schedules

    You set up when and how users receive workflow notifications by filling the **Notification Schedule** page for each workflow user. For more information, see [Specify When and How to Receive Notifications](across-how-to-specify-when-and-how-to-receive-notifications.md).  
* Customize the email notifications

    If you want, you can customize the content of the email notification by modifying report 1320, Notification Email. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  
* Response options

    You set up specific content and rules of a workflow notification when you create the workflow in question. You do this by selecting options on the **Workflow Response Options** page for the workflow response that represents the notification. For more information, see step 9 in [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).  

* Notify sender

    For approval workflows, add a workflow response step to notify the sender when the request has been approved or rejected. For more information, see step 9 in [Create Workflows](across-how-to-create-workflows.md).
