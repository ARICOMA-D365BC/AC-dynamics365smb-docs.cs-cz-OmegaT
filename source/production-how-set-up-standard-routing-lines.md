# Set Up Standard Routing Lines

The use of standard tasks simplifies the creation and maintenance of routings. They allow you to quickly attach extra information to recurring operations.

## To set up a standard task

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Standard Tasks**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
4. Choose the **Tools**, **Personnel**, **Description**, or **Tools** action, and then, on the page that opens, add the relevant entry.

## To add a standard task to an operation

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Routings**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant routing.
3. Select a relevant routing line, choose the **Operations** action, and then choose the **Tools**, **Personnel**, **Description**, or **Tools** action.

When you print the routing sheeting, you can choose to include the elements from the standard task that you added to the routing lines.
