# Get the Business Central Add-in for Outlook

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Outlook add-in, you can see financial data related to customers and vendors. You can also create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

There are two ways to get the Business Central add-in for Outlook installed, depending on your role in the organization:

- As a Microsoft 365 administrator, use *Centralized Deployment* to install the add-in automatically for the entire organization, groups, or specific users.

- As any user, install the add-in for your own use, if your admin hasn't already deployed it for you.

## About the Business Central add-in for Outlook

The Business Central add-in for Outlook consists of two smaller add-ins:

- Contact insights

    This add-in provides users with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] customer or vendor information in Outlook emails and calendar appointments. It also enables you to create and send [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] business documents, such sales quotes and invoices to a contact. <!--To support these task, the add-in adds actions to the Outlook ribbon, in the **Business Central** group. --> 

- Document view

    When an email refers to a business document number in the email body, this add-in provides a direct, in-line link from email body to the actual business document in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For more information about what you do with the add-ins, see [Using Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](work-outlook-addin.md).

Each add-in is provided as an XML file, called a *manifest*, which must be installed in Outlook of anyone who wants this functionality. These files describe how to activate the add-ins and connect to Business Central when they're used in Outlook. Working with these files is typically done by an admin. As a normal user, in most cases, you won't have to handle with these files directly. Either your admin will set up the add-in to install automatically for you or you'll use the built-in assisted setup to handle the installation.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment as an admin

Centralized Deployment is a feature in Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Outlook. It's the recommended way for admins to deploy for Office add-ins to users and groups within your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> For Business Central on-premises, see [Setting Up the Add-In for Outlook Integration with Business Central On-Premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/setting-up-office-add-ins-outlook-inbox) in the administration content (English only).

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 subscription  
- Users are assigned a Microsoft 365 license  
- Your Microsoft 365 account has the *Global Administrator* or *Exchange Administrator* role

### Deploy the add-in

1. In Business Central, choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose **Outlook Add-in Centralized Deployment** to start the assisted setup guide.
3. Review the first page and choose **Next** to open the page for downloading the add-ins.
4. In the **Deploy** column, select the check box for the add-ins that you want to deploy, then choose **Download and Continue**.

    A file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device.

5. At this point, you're finished with the work you need to do in Business Central, so you can choose **Done**.

   >[!TIP]
   > Before you choose **Next**, select the **Go to Microsoft 365 (opens in a new window)** link to open and sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a new browser window. You'll have to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center in a later step anyways.

6. Go the folder where the OutlookAddins.zip was downloaded, and extract the **Contact Insights.xml** and **Document View.xml** files from the .zip to a folder of your choice.

    For more information, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
7. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, then go to [Integrated Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967).

8. Choose **Upload custom apps**.
9. On the **Upload Apps to deploy** page, choose **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device** > **Choose file**.
10. Select one of the add-files you extracted earlier, for example, **Content Insights.xml**.
11. Follow the instructions to assign users and deploy the add-in.
12. Repeat step 9 through 11 for the other add-in file if you want.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A green check mark appears when the add-in is deployed to the admin center. However, it can take up to 24 hours before users see the add-in in Outlook app. Users might have to restart Outlook as well.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-in).

    - If you see the **Download Add-in** button, choose it, then go to the next step.
4. When you choose **Download Add-in**, a file with the name *OutlookAddins.zip* is downloaded to your device. You should see the file at the top of the browser.

For more information about how to extract files, see [Zip and Unzip files and folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
