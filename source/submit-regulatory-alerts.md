# Submit Alerts about Country/Region-Specific Regulatory Features

We invite you to use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to submit regulatory alerts through the Dynamics regulatory alert submission service.  

## To submit a regulatory alert in LCS

1. Go to https://lcs.dynamics.com and log in  

    You will be presented with the projects you have access to

2. Select the **Regulatory Alerts - Worldwide** project

    This will open the project and show a variety of things related to this project

3. Select the **Alert service** on the right side in the **More tools** section

    You will see a list of alerts with the headline **Dynamics Regulatory Alert Submission**

4. You can add a new alert by clicking the plus sign **(+)** sign at the top of the list

    This will present you with a 4-step guide to create the alert. The guide has the following steps:
    - Search for existing items
