# Select a Check Layout
You can design your checks to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Check images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Checks are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian check image formats in either a check-stub-check format or a stub-stub-check format.

## To select a check layout
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** page, in the **Usage** field, select **Check**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID | Report Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1401 |Check |This is the default report. |
| 10411 |Check (Stub/Stub/Check) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/stub/check format. |
| 10412 |Check (Stub/Check/Stub) |This report is designed to print checks in a stub/check/stub format. |
| 10413 |Three Checks per Page |This report is designed to print three checks on each page. |

When you have set up check layouts, you can print checks from the **Payment Journal** page. For more information, see [Work with Checks](payables-how-work-checks.md).

To change one of these default check layouts, use either the Word or the RDLC integration to do so. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

## Using MICR and Security Fonts
The online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contains pre-installed fonts on the servers that can be used when defining check layouts. The following outlines which fonts are available and has links to detailed information by the 3rd-party suppliers of the fonts.

> [!Important]
> MICR and check security fonts in Microsoft Dynamics [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are licensed in a font package from IDAutomation.com, Inc. These products may only be used as part of and in connection with Microsoft Dynamics [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

In update 15.3 and newer, Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) fonts are installed and available to use. Both the E-13B and the CMC-7 standards are supported. In addition to MICR fonts, special security fonts are available to generate text, names, amounts, and the currency symbols Dollar, Euro, Pound, and Yen, which are hard to tamper with once a check has been printed.

> [!NOTE]
