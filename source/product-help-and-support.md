# Resources for Help and Support

Tips and guidance for how to use [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)], how to get unblocked, where to learn more, and how to find technical information is all available from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This article describes how to find what.  

## In-product tips

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)] These links can also access content that is published to other websites, such as the websites of providers of any apps that are installed in your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2022_releasewave1](includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner) gives you access to a Help pane that can help you find answers to your questions. The Help pane has different content, depending on how you access it. The following list describes the cards that are always, or nearly always, present:  

[!INCLUDE [ua-help-pane-links-default](includes/ua-help-pane-links-default.md)]

The following list describes how you can access the Help pane and whether cards are added to it:

- Choose the *Learn more* link on a tooltip for a field

  The following card is added to the Help pane:

  - The field's tooltip
- Choose the *Learn more* link on a tooltip for an action
- Choose the Help menu item (the question mark in the top-right corner)
- Use the Ctrl+F1 keyboard shortcut from anywhere

> [!TIP]
> When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to un-dock the browser tab, then, so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

## Search in the Help pane

[!INCLUDE [2021_releasewave2](includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

Use the search field at the top of the Help pane to search for guidance about how to use the product, built-in capabilities, and available training modules. Depending on your search terms, the pane shows five or more links with a short description. Choose a link, or refine your search terms. When you choose a link, the target article opens in a new browser tab. You can choose to un-dock the browser tab, then, so that you can view the relevant information side-by-side with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The pane remains open while you navigate through [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that content you searched for remains visible.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the current version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the search field in the Help pane only applies to content that is published to the [Docs.microsoft.com](/dynamics365/business-central) site.

## Help & Support page

From the Help pane, you can access the **Help & Support** page inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that includes helpful links. You can also see how you can contact technical support for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

This section outlines the resources available to you in the different sections of the **Help and Support** page as outlined in the following list:

- [Find answers](#find-answers)  
- [Help](#product-help)  
- [Community](#community)  
- [Blog](#blog)  
- [Capabilities coming soon](#capabilities-coming-soon)  
- [Do more with your trial](#do-more-with-your-trial)  
- [Give feedback](#give-feedback)  
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)  
- [Report a problem](#report-a-problem)  
- [Support contacts](#support-contacts)  

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Find Answers

The **Find it** section provides links to the most common places to find answers to your questions. The links fall into four categories and are explained in the following subsections. Some of the links can be configured by your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner, and as a result the behavior can be slightly different.  

#### Product Help

The **Find it** section includes two links to product Help:

- Help about the page you were just viewing in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  This link is automatically generated. If [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] can't find the relevant link, the landing page on [Docs.microsoft.com](index.md) for the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is shown. For example, if the page was part of an app that didn't add context-sensitive Help mapping to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the *Learn link* defaults to the landing page.  
  
- Help landing page for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]  

  The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described on the [Docs.microsoft.com](/dynamics365/business-central) site. For more information, see the [Use the docs.microsoft.com site to learn more](#use-the-docsmicrosoftcom-site-to-learn-more) section. You can also extend and customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with apps from AppSource. All apps provide links to the relevant product Help so that you can always find guidance for the different workflows in your version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

#### Community

In the [Business Central Forum](https://community.dynamics.com/business/f), you can submit a question and learn from other [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] community members. Partners and Microsoft employees participate in the conversations.  

If you don't yet have a partner, the Community can also help you get unblocked if you have questions. For example, if you just signed up for a trial, the Community can be a great starting point.  

#### Blog

We talk about new capabilities on [the Dynamics 365 Blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/product/business-central/), including if there are special considerations.  

#### Capabilities coming soon

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is updated with major feature updates every six months, and with monthly service updates. Choose the link to view the latest release plan. You can also get an overview of upcoming and recently released capabilities in [the release plans across Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

For the longer term overview, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] [roadmap page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/roadmap/business-central/) shows the general priorities for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the coming years.  

### Do more with your trial

This section gives you shortcuts to Microsoft AppSource where you can find solutions and services from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partners. Use the links to explore the full capabilities of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] before you decide if you want to buy a subscription. You can also find a link to contact the sales team.

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online trial experiences. If you already bought [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the section isn't longer visible.

### Give feedback

On the [Dynamics 365 Ideas site](https://aka.ms/bcideas), you can provide suggestions for new feature and capabilities. Your input goes directly to Business Central's engineering backlog for investigation and prioritization.  

Make sure that you search through the list of submitted suggestions. Chances are that someone already submitted something similar, and that entry might have already received votes. Vote if an idea already has been submitted to get it prioritized on the engineering backlog.  

### Troubleshooting

The **Troubleshooting** section shows technical information that your administrator or [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner can use to unblock users. The section includes information about the latest error message, the current version of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and a link to go to the **Page Inspection** page. For more information, see [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](across-inspect-page.md).  

To help you or your supporting partner troubleshoot, you can switch on additional logging in the **Report a Problem** section. You can then analyze the additional telemetry in the admin center or Application Insights, for example.  

As the internal administrator, you have access to the admin center where you can continue the troubleshooting. You can view telemetry, manage environments, and manage user sessions. The following articles in the administration content provide more information:

- [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information)  
- [Managing environments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments)  
- [Monitoring and analyzing telemetry](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview)  
- [Enable sending telemetry to Application Insights](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights)  

### Report a problem

Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner will help you with technical support. This section makes it easy for you to contact your reselling partner, if they've submitted their support contact details. If your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner then can't resolve the problem, they'll raise a support ticket with Microsoft.  

For more information, see [Escalating support issues to Microsoft](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#escalating-support-issues-to-microsoft) in the administration content.  

> [!NOTE]
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the **Report a Problem** section is only available if you have paid for a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] subscription. If you have signed up for a trial and have not yet purchased [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you don't have a reselling partner, and you can't contact the Microsoft support team. You can find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner on the [I'm looking for a solution provider](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145) page. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](/dynamics365/business-central/across-faq#findpartner).  
>
> With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, this section is only available in 2020 release wave 2 (version 18) and later.

### Support contacts

The **Report a problem** section displays an email address or a hyperlink for you to get in contact with the customer support person or team. If you are the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner for a tenant, you can set up your preferred support contact details in the admin center. For more information, see [Configuring the support experience](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/technical-support#configuring-the-support-experience) in the administration content.  

To alert your partner to a problem, choose the link to either send an email or open their support site in a new browser tab. You can then add the technical information about your Azure Active Directory tenant from the **Troubleshooting** section and any other information that you find relevant.  

> [!NOTE]
> The support contacts information isn't available with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

## Use the docs.microsoft.com site to learn more

The base version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is extended and customized by a large community of partners. Each partner and many customers deploy their own Help to their own website. But you can always go to the [docs.microsoft.com](index.md) site to learn more. The site hosts different types of content, such as the following:

- [Conceptual content about business functionality](index.md)  
- [Documentation for developers](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-dev-overview)  
- [Free learning paths and e-learning modules across multiple user profiles](/learn/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs)  

In this section, you can learn about how to navigate the business functionality content.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-get-help](includes/ua-get-help.md)]

### Content on the site

[This section](index.md) of the docs.microsoft.com site hosts content from Microsoft that represents the *Learn more* pillar in the user assistance model. In part, the *Learn more* content intends to answer those questions that the user interface can't answer, such as the following:

- Where does this page fits into the bigger workflow?  
- What comes next?  
- What would be the alternative?  

From inside the product, you can access this content either through the *Learn more* link in tooltips and teaching tips, or by using the *Ctrl+F1* keyboard shortcut.  

The navigation panel to the left, the table of contents, groups articles by business area. For example, you read the article [Purchase Items for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md), and then the table of contents shows you that there's also an article called [Correct or Cancel Unpaid Purchase Invoices](purchasing-how-correct-cancel-unpaid-purchase-invoices.md). Both articles are in the group called *Purchasing*, which bundles articles that are related to the Purchasing module in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

The table of contents includes a group of content that describes [local functionality](about-localization.md) for the countries that Microsoft supports. If you don't see your country listed there, it's probably because your country is localized by a partner. For more information, see [Country/regional availability and supported languages](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations).  

The local functionality content describes the capabilities in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that can help you be compliant in the supported markets, such as tax statements and other reports. In some cases, the difference between the default version and the country-specific version is invisible to users. In other cases, users must set up reporting or electronic invoicing in a specific way. If you can't find a description of a certain button or action in the general section, you can hopefully find it in the *Local Functionality* section.  

> [!TIP]
> On the docs.microsoft.com site as well as in the in-product search field and in the Help pane, the search results show some context for the target article. The context includes the link that might show the name of a country, or a short description that calls out a certain capability or a country, for example.

### Finding other content

If you land on an article that doesn't answer your question, you can find other content in two ways on the docs.microsoft.com site:

- Use the **Filter by title** field in the table of contents on the left side of the website

  This way, you can filter by words used in the titles of the various articles. For example, type *invoice*, and then choose one of the offered links, such as [Set Up Invoice Rounding](finance-set-up-invoice-rounding.md) or [Create Prepayment Invoices](finance-how-to-create-prepayment-invoices.md).  

  Underneath each link,  you can see where that article is in the table of contents. That way, you can easily see if the article is in the Purchasing section or in the section for Australian local functionality, for example.  
- Use the **Search** field in the top-right corner of the website

  This way, you can search for any term. The site will then search all the content for that term or expression. Search for *invoice* again, and scroll through the list of hundreds of articles in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] content that uses that word somewhere in the text.  

### Languages

Content about business functionality is published in several languages. When you land on the docs.microsoft.com site from inside the product, you see the content in the same language as you've specified in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], unless that language isn't available on the docs.microsoft.co. site.  

You can change the language by changing the URL, or you can use the language toggle in the bottom-left corner of the website.  

The content is authored in English and published to URLs with *en-us* as the language code. When new information is published in English, it's then sent off for translation into the supported languages. In some cases, you will not be able to read this new content in your own language for up to four weeks, but in most cases it only takes a week or two. You can always view the latest information by switching the language to *en-us*.  

For each language, the table of contents is translated, but the content in the *Local Functionality* section is in English except for the country that corresponds to the current language. For example, in the Danish version of the docs.microsoft.com site (`https://docs.microsoft.com/da-dk/dynamics365/business-central/`), you can see the entries for Australian local functionality in Danish in the table of contents, but the articles are in English. Only the articles for Danish local functionality are translated into Danish.  

### Recommended content

In March 2021, a new section appeared under most articles on the docs.microsoft.com site. The **Recommended content** section is automatically generated based on how each article is used with the rest of the docs.microsoft.com site. The links aren't static and change over time.

### Tell us what you think

On docs.microsoft.com, each article has two buttons at the end of the article. The *This product* button sends you to the Ideas site, and the **This page** button lets you submit feedback about the content through GitHub. In both cases, you must create an account if you don't already have one. For *product feedback*, you must sign in with your work or organizational email account. For *access to GitHub*, you can use any email address when you create an account.  

We welcome your contributions, both as pull requests with suggestions or corrections to the content, and as GitHub Issues with bugs or questions. But please be mindful that feedback and contributions to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo is about the content, not about the product.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft accepts pull requests to the *dynamics365smb-docs* repo only, not the language-specific repos. If you have feedback about translations, you can report a GitHub issue in the relevant repo.  

### Navigating to other parts of the site

The docs.microsoft.com hosts content for other products and other types of content. Use the links at the top of the site to navigate to the [Microsoft Learn site](/learn/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) site or to the [Dynamics 365 release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/), for example. You can also find a link to the
[Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/) site, for example.  

## Apps and other solutions

If your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes functionality that isn't provided by Microsoft, then the provider of that functionality also provides *Learn more* content on their own website. You can access this content in the same way as in the default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], such as by using the *Ctrl+F1* keyboard shortcut.  

The same applies if you use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.
