# Developing Business Central Report Layouts and Datasets

A report in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] consists of a report object that defines the _dataset_ of the report (what data is available) and a number of _report layouts_ (how data is presented).  

## Developing report layouts

Maybe you want to modify existing report layouts provided in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]? Depending on the technology used for the layout, this is something you might be able to do yourself (Excel and maybe also Word layouts), or maybe you need a developer to do it (pixel-perfect RDLC layouts).

## Developing report datasets

 To change the dataset definitions that define what data is available in the report, you need a developer that knows about the AL programming language and the tools to develop report objects and report extensions.
