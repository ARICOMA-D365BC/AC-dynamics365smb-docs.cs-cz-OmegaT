# Financial Reports and Analytics in Business Central

Financial reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] allows financial and business professionals to create, maintain, deploy, and view financial statements. It moves beyond traditional reporting constraints to help you efficiently design various types of reports. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes several reports, tracing functions, and tools that help auditors or controllers who are responsible for reporting to the finance department. Financial reporting includes support for dimensions, so account segments or dimensions are immediately available. No other tools or configuration steps are required.
