# Setting Up or Changing the Chart of Accounts
The chart of accounts shows the ledger accounts that store your financial data. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business.
However, you can change the default accounts, and you can add new accounts.

## Adding or Changing Accounts
From the chart of accounts, you can open each G/L account and add or change settings.

> [!NOTE]  
>   You can delete a general ledger account. However, before you delete it, the following must be true:  
>  
>   * The balance on the account must be zero.  
>   * The **Allow G/L Acc. Deletion Before** field must be set on the **General Ledger Setup** page, and the account must not have ledger entries on or after that date.  
>   * If the **Check G/L Account Usage** field on the **General Ledger Setup** page is selected, then the account must not be used in any posting groups or posting setup.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will prevent you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.
