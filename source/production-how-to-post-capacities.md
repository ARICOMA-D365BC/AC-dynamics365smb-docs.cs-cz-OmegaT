# Post Capacities
In the capacity journal, you post consumed capacities that are not assigned to the production order. For example, maintenance work must be assigned to capacity, but not to a production order.  

## To post capacities  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Capacity Journals**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the **Posting Date** and **Document No.** fields.  
3.  In the **Type** field, enter the type of the capacity, either **Machine Center** or **Work Center**, that you are posting.  
4.  In the **No.** field, enter the number of the machine center or work center.  
5.  Enter the relevant data in the other fields, such as **Starting Time**, **Ending Time**, **Quantity**, and **Scrap**.  
6.  Choose the **Post** action to post the capacities.  

## To view work center ledger entries  
In the **Work Center Card** and **Machine Center Card** pages, you can view the posted capacities as a result of finished production orders.    
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Work Centers**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Open the relevant **Work Center** card from the list, and then choose the **Capacity Ledger Entries** action.  

The **Capacity Ledger Entries** page displays the posted entries from the work center in the order they were posted.
