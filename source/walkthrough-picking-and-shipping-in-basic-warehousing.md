[!INCLUDE[complete_sample_data](includes/complete_sample_data.md)]

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the outbound processes for picking and shipping can be performed in four ways using different functionalities depending on the warehouse complexity level.  

|Method|Inbound process|Bins|Picks|Shipments|Complexity level (See [Design Details: Warehouse Setup](design-details-warehouse-setup.md))|  
|------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|A|Post pick and shipment from the order line|X|||2|  
|B|Post pick and shipment from an inventory pick document||X||3|  
|C|Post pick and shipment from a warehouse shipment document|||X|4/5/6|  
|D|Post pick from a warehouse pick document and post shipment from a warehouse shipment document||X|X|4/5/6|  

For more information, see [Design Details: Outbound Warehouse Flow](design-details-outbound-warehouse-flow.md).

## About This Walkthrough

In basic warehouse configurations where your location is set up to require pick processing but not ship processing, you use the **Inventory Pick** page to record and post pick and ship information for your outbound source documents. The outbound source document can be a sales order, purchase return order, outbound transfer order, or a production order with component need.  

This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:  

- Setting up SILVER location for inventory picks.  
- Creating a sales order for customer 10000 for 30 loudspeakers.  
- Releasing the sales order for warehouse handling.  
- Creating an inventory pick based on a released source document.  
- Registering the warehouse movement from the warehouse and at the same time posting the sales shipment for the source sales order.

John, the warehouse worker must make sure that the shipment is prepared and delivered to the customer. John manages all involved tasks on the **Inventory Pick** page, which automatically points to the bins where LS-81 is stored.
