# Tips and Tricks: RapidStart Services

When you configure companies using RapidStart Services, there are some tips and tricks that you can take advantage of to help your implementation go smoothly.  

## Take advantage of configuration templates

Configuration templates can help you streamline your implementation process. By using them, you can include similar customers in segments and then develop an implementation protocol that treats all customers in a segment in a similar manner. In that way, you can apply a level of preconfiguration to each segment and continue with a rapid implementation.  

## Configuration questionnaires

To aid the process of filling out a configuration questionnaire, consider defining default answers to indicate best practices.  

## Batch creation of journal lines

We recommend that you use the data migration tools provided to migrate journal entries. Otherwise, if you use a batch job to create journal lines, that has a limited scope and only generates pre-default fields into a journal. The rest of the journal then has to be completed manually.  

## Migrating transactions

We recommend that you migrate opening balances in the following order. <!--Be aware that you cannot insert ledger entries directly. Instead you must use journals to post the journal lines-->

1. Migrate general ledger opening balances without using the general ledger account subledgers. Use specific opening balance offsetting accounts, one set up for each subledger. Set up the offsetting accounts to enable direct postings.  
2. Migrate open customer ledger entries.  <!--work on these-->
3. Migrate open item ledger entries.  
4. Migrate open fixed asset entries.  

## Make each package manageable

When you use configuration packages to migrate data, separate the data into separate packages for easier portability. For example, if you want to migrate 20 years of ledger entries, the import might take many hours and days. Instead, split the data up so that each package becomes more manageable. Currently, there are no firm rules for what makes a package performant, but if you see problems importing or exporting a package, try making it smaller and see if that helps.
