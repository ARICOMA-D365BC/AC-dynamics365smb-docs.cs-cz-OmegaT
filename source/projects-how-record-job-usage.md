# Record Usage for Jobs

On the **Job Planning Lines** page, you can review and record usage on various parts of your job, which is automatically updated as you modify and transfer information between jobs and job journals or job invoices. This requires that you have set up a job so that the **Apply Usage Link by Default** is turned on. For more information, see [Set Up Jobs](projects-how-setup-jobs.md).  

For example, for planning lines of type **Budget**, you can enter the quantity of a resource, and indicate what quantity to transfer to the job journal. If the type of the planning line is **Billable**, you can enter the quantity of the resource, and indicate what quantity to transfer to an invoice. By comparing the quantity that has been transferred to the journal or invoice with the remaining quantity, you can quickly review usage information.

The following procedures describe how to record actual (billable) or budgeted job prices and costs. For information about estimating budgeted values during planning, see [Manage Job Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).  

> [!TIP]
> In the following sections, we use the term *record usage* to cover two tasks: Record job planning lines and invoice the customer accordingly.

## To record usage for a job planning line of type Budget

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Jobs**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Select the relevant job, and then choose the **Job Planning Lines** action.
3. Select a job planning line of type **Budget** or **Both Budget and Billable** for which you want to record usage.
4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Journal** field, enter the number that you want to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Remaining Quantity** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the job and be transferred to the journal.  
5. Choose the **Create Job Journal Lines** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more job planning lines for this job, wait with this step until you have added all job planning lines.
6. On the **Job Transfer Job Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
7. Choose the **Open Job Journal** action.

10. Repeat steps 3 through 8 to record additional usage.  

## To record usage for a job planning line of type Billable

In the next task, you also record usage, but for a job planning line of type **Billable**. Typically, in this case, you invoice your usage, but you can also transfer it to a journal. However, when you do that, a job planning line of type **Budget** is created to match the billable line. For more information, see [Manage Job Budgets](projects-how-manage-budgets.md).

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Jobs**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant job, and then choose the **Job Planning Lines** action.  
3. Select a job planning line of type **Billable** for which you want to record usage.
4. In the **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** field, enter the number that you want to transfer. The default quantity is the value that you enter in the **Quantity** field.

    The **Quantity to Invoice** field shows the quantity that remains to complete the job and be invoiced.  
5. Choose the **Create Sales Invoice** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are going to add more job planning lines for this job, wait with this step until you have added all job planning lines.
6. On the **Job Transfer to Sales Invoice** page, fill in the fields as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button.
7. Review the recorded usage by observing the **Quantity**, **Quantity to Invoice**, **Qty. To Transfer to Invoice** fields, and, if the sales invoice is posted, the **Qty. Invoiced** fields.
8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 to record additional usage.  
9. To review a related posted sales invoice, choose the **Sales Invoices/Credit Memos** action.  

    If more than one invoice exists for this job, you must choose the relevant invoice on the **Job Invoices** page, and then choose the **Open Sales Invoice/Credit Memo** action.  

## To create job journal lines from job planning lines

When you are ready to post financial information for jobs, you must create job journal lines that you can post.

3. On the **Job Planning Lines** page, on a relevant job planning line, in the **Qty. to Transfer to Journal** field, enter the quantity that you want to transfer to a job journal.  
4. Choose the **Create Job Journal Lines** action.
5. On the **Job Transfer Job Planning Line** page, fill in the fields as necessary.  
6. Choose the **OK** button. Job journal lines are created.
