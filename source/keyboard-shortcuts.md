# Keyboard Shortcuts

This article provides an overview of some of the shortcut key combinations that you can use when you're working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

For an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts (PC only)](keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.md).

> [!TIP]
> For a graphical view of the most used shortcuts, choose the following image and download the PDF file.

## Overview

Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. They're supported by most web browsers, however, the behavior may vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> The keyboard shortcuts described here refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. The layout of the keys on other keyboards may not correspond exactly to the keys on a U.S. keyboard.

Most of the shortcuts are the same whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are indicated with brackets in the following sections.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts described in this topic, a number of business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], F9 posts a document and Ctrl+F7 shows the ledger entries for a record when you open the record in a card. (These may be different in your solution.) The keyboard shortcut is shown in the tooltip for the action in question.

##  <a name="Keyboard"></a> General Keyboard Shortcuts

The following table describes keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, drop-down lists, lookups, and more. For details about keyboard shortcuts for navigating records once you get inside a list, see the next section.

|Press these keys<br />(in macOS)|To do this|
|--------------------------------|----------|
|Alt+Down Arrow|Open a drop-down list or look up a value for a field.|
|Alt+Up Arrow|Show tooltip for a field or a column header of a table. If the field has validation errors, press Alt+Up Arrow to show the validation error. Press Esc or Alt+Up Arrow to close the tooltip.|
|F2|Toggle between selecting the entire field value or placing the cursor at the end of the field value.|
|Alt+F2|Show and hide the FactBox pane.|
|Alt+Shift+F2|Shift between **Details** and **Attachments** in the FactBox pane.|
|Alt+O|Add a new note for the selected record, even if the FactBox pane isn't open.|

|Alt+N |Open a page to create a new record. (Similar to choosing the **New** and **+** actions.)|
|Alt+Shift+N |Close a newly created page and open a new one to create a new record. Similarly, Alt+F9 posts a document and creates a new one.|
|Alt+T|Open the **My Settings** page.|
|Alt+Right Arrow|Look up additional information or underlying values for a field that contains the ![AssistEdit](media/assist-edit-icon.png "AssistEdit button") button. This is used when the usual drop-down button (Alt+Down Arrow) in the same field is used for another purpose.|
|Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C|Display information in the company badge.|
|Ctrl+Alt+F1|Open and close the page inspection pane. The page inspection pane shows information about the page, like its source table, fields, filters, extensions, and more.<br /><br />For more information, see [Inspecting Pages](across-inspect-page.md).|
|Ctrl+C |Copy the value of field. If the field is in focus, and you haven't selected any text in the field, this will copy the entire value. If you've selected any text in the field, then it will copy the selected text only.|

|F5|Refresh the data on the current page.<br /><br />Use this key to ensure that the data on the page is up to date with any changes that others have made while you're working.|
|Enter|Enable or access the element or control that is in focus.|
|Esc|Close the current page or drop-down list.|
|Tab|Move focus to the next control or element on a page, such as actions, buttons, fields, or list headings.|
|Shift+Tab|Move focus to the previous control or element on a page, such as actions, buttons, fields, or list headings.|
|Y and N|Activate **Yes** and **No** buttons in dialog boxes. Actual keys will vary based on your current language specified in **My Settings**. For example, press J to activate the **Ja** button when using German language.|

## Keyboard Shortcuts in Lists

The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts that you can use on a list page. The shortcut action is slightly different depending on whether the page is shown in the list view or tile view.
<!--
> [!Note]
> In the table that follows, the term *actionable field* refers to a field on which you can do something, like change a value or link to another page. In general, the shortcuts will skip over fields that display information that you cannot change from the list (in other words, fields that are read-only).
