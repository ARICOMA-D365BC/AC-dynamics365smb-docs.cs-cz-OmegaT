# Detecting Mandatory Fields

When you enter data, you might see a red asterisk next to a field. The asterisk means that the field is required for a certain process. For example, you're about to post a transaction, but you've not filled in an important field.

The visual clue doesn't force you to fill in the field. The red asterisk is a reminder that you're blocked from completing a process.

## Examples

On the **Customer Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you can't post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

On the **Item Card** page, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you can't enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.
