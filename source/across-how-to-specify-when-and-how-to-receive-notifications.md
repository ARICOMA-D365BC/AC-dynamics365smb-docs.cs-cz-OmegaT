# Specify When and How to Receive Notifications
When you set up users in approval workflows, you must specify in the **Notification Setup** and **Notification Schedule** pages how and when each user receives notifications about approval workflow steps. Individual users can also change their notification setup by choosing the **Change Notification Settings** button on any notification.  

> [!NOTE]
> Notifications are delivered according to notification settings for the receiver, not the sender. That's an important distinction because it means that when someone requests an approval as part of a workflow their request is not necessarily sent immediately. Instead, it will be delivered according to the approvers's notification settings. 

 Before you can set up an approval userâ€™s notification preferences, you must set the user up as an approval user. For more information, [Set Up Approval Users](across-how-to-set-up-approval-users.md).  

 You can define the layout of email notifications by customizing Report 1320, Notification Email. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).  

 Many approval workflow steps are about notifying users that an event has occurred that they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record. The related response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a process with the approved record. For workflow steps that are about approval, each notification is tied to an approval entry. For more information, see [Workflow](across-workflow.md).  

## Specify when and how users receive notifications  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Approval User Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the line for the user that you want to set up notification preferences for, and then choose the **Notification Setup** action.  
3.  On the **Notification Setup** page, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Notification Type**|Specify what type of event the notification is about.<br /><br /> Select one of the following options:<br /><br /> -   **New Record** specifies that the notification is about a new record, such as a document, that the user must act on.<br />-   **Approval** specifies that the notification is about one or more approval requests.<br />-   **Overdue** specifies that the notification is to remind users that they are late in acting on an event.|  
    |**Notification Method**|Specify if the notification is an email or an internal note.|

    You can define the layout of email notifications by customizing Report 1320, Notification Email. For more information, see [Create and Modify Custom Report Layouts](ui-how-create-custom-report-layout.md).

    You have now specified how the user receives notifications. Proceed to specify when the user receives notifications.  

4.  Choose the **Notification Schedule** action.  
5.  On the **Notification Schedule** page, fill the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Recurrence**|Specify the recurrence pattern in which the user receives notifications.|  
    |**Time**|Specify what time of the day the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is different from **Instantly**.|  
    |**Daily Frequency**|Specify on which type of days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Daily**.<br /><br /> Select **Weekday** to receive notifications every work day of the week. Select **Daily** to receive notifications every day of the week, including weekends.|  
    |**Monday** through **Sunday**|Specify on which days the user receives notifications when the value in the **Recurrence** field is **Weekly**.|  
    |**Date of Month**|Specify if the user receives notifications on the first, last, or a specific date of the month.|  
    |**Monthly Notification Date**|Specify the date of the month on which the user receives notifications when the value in the **Date of Month** field is **Custom**.|
