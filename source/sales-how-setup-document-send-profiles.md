# Set Up Document Sending Profiles
You can set each customer up with a preferred method of sending sales documents, so that you do not have to select a sending option every time you choose the **Post and Send** action.

On the **Document Sending Profiles** page, you set up different sending profiles that you can select from in the **Document Sending Profile** field on a customer card. You can select the **Default** check box to specify that the document sending profile is the default profile for all customers, except for customers where the **Document Sending Profile** field is filled with another sending profile.

When you choose the **Post and Send** action on a sales document, the **Post and Send Confirmation** dialog box shows the sending profile used, either the one set up for the customer or the default for all customers. In the dialog box, you can change the sending profile for the sales document. For more information, see [Invoice Sales](sales-how-invoice-sales.md).
