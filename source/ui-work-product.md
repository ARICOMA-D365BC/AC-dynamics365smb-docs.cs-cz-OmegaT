# Working with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]
When performing business tasks, you interact with data in different ways, such as creating records and entering data, sorting and filtering data, writing notes, and outputting data to other applications.

For example, you can adjust the size and position of any page, expand the width of columns and increase the height of column headers, and change the sorting of data in columns. And if you want to use the horizontal scroll bar to view all columns on a list page or on document lines, you will see that there is a vertical freeze pane to restrict some columns from scrolling.

## Choosing a desktop browser

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple browsers that each offer a variety of features and capabilities. The browser plays a significant role in the responsiveness and fluidity of the user interface. See the list of supported, recommended browsers for [Business Central online](./product-requirements.md) and browsers for [Business Central on-premises](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/system-requirement-business-central-v15).

- Where possible, avoid older browsers such as Internet Explorer, and switch to one of our recommended modern browsers, such as the [new Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/).  

    Internet Explorer is no longer supported. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4337664/microsoft-edge-help).
- Keep your browser always updated to the latest version.
