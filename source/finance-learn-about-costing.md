# About Inventory Costing
Managing inventory costs is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of manufacturing costs and inventory costs, that is, the value of items.  

 Central principles to understand are that costing methods define how items are valued when they leave inventory, that cost adjustment updates the cost of goods sold with related purchase costs posted after the sale, and that inventory values must be posted to dedicated G/L accounts at regular intervals.  

 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

|------------|-------------|  
|Distinguish the five different costing methods and their effect on cost flows.|[Design Details: Costing Methods](design-details-costing-methods.md)|  
|Learn how item application entries dynamically link inventory decreases with increases to keep control of cost flows.|[Design Details: Item Application](design-details-item-application.md)|  
|Learn how an item's unit cost is continuously updated with the cost of its latest transaction according to the item's costing method.|[Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md)|  
|Learn how an item's average cost is dynamically calculated according to the selected average cost period.|[Design Details: Average Cost](design-details-average-cost.md)|  
|Distinguish expected cost (not yet invoiced) from actual cost and learn how it is managed in the general ledger.|[Design Details: Expected Cost Posting](design-details-expected-cost-posting.md)|  
|Understand the cost adjustment mechanism, which ensures that costs are brought forward even if inventory transactions happen in a random manner.|[Design Details: Cost Adjustment](design-details-cost-adjustment.md)|
