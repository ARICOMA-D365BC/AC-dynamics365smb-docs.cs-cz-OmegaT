# Manage Employee Absence
To manage an employee's absence, you must record the absence on the **Absence Registration** page. It can then be viewed in different ways for analysis and reporting needs.

You can view employee absence in two different pages:

* The **Absence Registration** page, where you register all employee absences with a line for each absence.
* The **Employee Absences** page, where the absences for one employee only is shown. This is the information that you entered on the **Absence Registration** page, filtered by the particular employee.

To obtain meaningful statistics, you should always use the same unit of measure (hour or day) when registering employee absences.

## To register employee absence
You can register employee absences on a daily basis or at some other interval that meets your organizational needs.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Absence Registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
3. Fill in a line for each employee absence you want to register.
4. Close the page.
