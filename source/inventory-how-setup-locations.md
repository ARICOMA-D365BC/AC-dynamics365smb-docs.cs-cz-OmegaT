# Set Up Locations
If you buy, store, or sell items at more than one place or warehouse, you must set each location up with a location card and define transfer routes.

You can then create document lines for a specific location, view availability by location, and transfer inventory between locations. For more information, see [Manage Inventory](inventory-manage-inventory.md).
