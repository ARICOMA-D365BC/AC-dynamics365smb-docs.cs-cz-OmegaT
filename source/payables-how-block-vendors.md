# Block Vendors
You can block a vendor, for example because of insolvency, so that the vendor cannot be added to purchase documents or so that no payments can be posted for the vendor.

The following table describes the options for blocking vendors.  

|Option|Description|  
|--------------------|------------|  
|**Blank**|Transactions are allowed for this vendor.|
|**Payment**|New payments cannot be created for this vendor.|  
|**All**|No transactions are allowed for this vendor.|  

## To block a vendor  
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the vendor that you want to block.
3. In the **Blocked** field, choose one of the options for blocking.
