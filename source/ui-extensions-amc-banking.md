# Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals Extension
The AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension makes it easier, and more accurate, to send data to your banks. The extension connects [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] with the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central service, which can convert bank data from [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] into formats that are required by over 600 banks around the world. For example, this makes it easier to transfer payments and credits to vendors by entering the payments in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], and then uploading them to your bank. The formats can also smooth out bank reconciliation processes. For more information, see [AMC Banking for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://amcbanking.com/landing365bc/help).

> [!Note]
> AMC Banking has built additional extensions that work with [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)]. This topic describes only the Fundamental extension.

## Using Our Demonstration Account
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] comes with a demonstration account that lets you try out the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension. We provide default settings for connecting to AMC Banking, specifying the bank accounts to get data from in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], plus a few data exchange definitions. You can view the connection settings on the **AMC Banking Setup** page. For bank accounts, the extension applies values in the **Bank Name**, **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**, **Bank Statement Import Format**, and **Payment Export Format** fields on bank account cards.

We provide the settings, but to try out the extension you must run the assisted setup guide to apply them. To run the guide, on the **AMC Banking Setup** page, choose the **Assisted Setup** action.

> [!Note]
> There are some limitations on the demo account. For example, when you convert payments, the amount in the converted file will not match the actual amount. Instead, the amount will always be five units of the currency that you use for payments.

## Setting Up the Extension
Getting started with the extension involves just a few easy steps, and an assisted setup guide will make the connection and turn on the extension. The guide will do things like install the data exchange definitions for bank statement export/import setups and initiate the number series used for credit transfer messages.

### To set up the required permission sets
Before people can use this extension, your administrator must copy the following permission sets, edit them, and then assign the new permission sets to users instead of original:

* **D365 Basic**
* **D365 Team Member**
* **D365 Read**
* **IntelligentCloudBC**

For more information, see [To copy a permission set](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-copy-a-permission-set).

For each new permission set, grant only the **Read** permission for the **AMC Banking Setup table (20101)**. For more information, see [To create or modify permissions manually](ui-define-granular-permissions.md#to-create-or-modify-permissions-manually).
