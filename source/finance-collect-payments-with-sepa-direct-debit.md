# Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit
With your customer's consent, you can collect payments directly from the customer's bank account according to the SEPA format.  

 First, set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit. Then, set up the customer's payment method. Last, set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.  

 To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection entry, which holds information about bank accounts, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. You then export an XML file that is based on the collection entry, which you send to your bank for processing. Any payments that could not be processed will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 You can set up standard customer sales codes with the direct-debit payment method and mandate information. You can then use the **Create Standard Cust. Invoices** batch job to generate multiple sales invoices with the direct-debit information prefilled. This is can be done manually or automatically, according to the payment due date.  

 When payments are successfully processed, as communicated by your bank, you can post the payment receipts either directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page or by moving the payment lines to the journal where you post payment receipts, such as the **Cash Receipt Journal** page. Alternatively, depending on your cash management process, you can wait and just apply the payments as a part of bank reconciliation.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

## Setting Up SEPA Direct Debit
From the **Direct Debit Collections** page, you can export instructions to your electronic bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account according to the SEPA Direct Debit format.

> [!NOTE]
> The global version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports the SEPA direct debit format only. Your country/region version may support other formats for electronic payment. See under **Local Functionality** in the table of contents.  

To enable export of a bank file formats that are not supported out of the box in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] , you can set up a data exchange definition by using the data exchange framework. For more information, see [Set Up Data Exchange Definitions](across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.md).  

Before you can process customer payments electronically by exporting direct debit instructions in the SEPA Direct Debit format, you must perform the following setup steps:  

* Set up the export format of the bank file that instructs your bank to perform a direct debit collection from the customer's bank account to your bank account.  
* Set up the customer's payment method.  
* Set up the direct-debit mandate that reflects your agreement with the customer to collect their payments in a certain agreement period.

## Creating SEPA Direct Debit Collection Entries and Export to a Bank File
 To instruct the bank to transfer the payment amount from the customer's bank account to your company's account, you create a direct-debit collection, which holds information about the customer's bank account, the affected sales invoices, and the direct-debit mandate. From the resulting direct-debit collection entry, you then export an XML file that you send or upload to your electronic bank for processing. Any payments that could not be processed by the bank will be communicated to you by your bank, and you must then manually reject the direct debit-collection entries in question.  

 > [!NOTE]  
 >  To collect payments using SEPA Direct Debit, the currency on the sales invoice must be EURO.  

### To create a direct-debit collection  

 1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Direct Debit Collections**, and then choose the related link.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Create Direct Debit Collection** action.  
 3. On the **Create Direct Debit Collection** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

     |Field|Description|  
     |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
     |**From Due Date**|Specify the earliest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
     |**To Due Date**|Specify the latest payment due date on sales invoices that you want to create a direct-debit collection for.|  
     |**Partner Type**|Specify if the direct-debit collection is made for customers of type **Company** or **Person**.|  
     |**Only Customers With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is created for customers who have a valid direct-debit mandate. **Note:**  A direct-debit collection is created even if the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field is not filled on the sales invoice.|  
     |**Only Invoices With Valid Mandate**|Specify if a direct-debit collection is only created for sales invoices if a valid direct-debit mandate is selected in the **Direct Debit Mandate ID** field on the sales invoice.|  
     |**Bank Account No.**|Specify which of your company's bank accounts the collected payment will be transferred to from the customer's bank account.|  
     |**Bank Account Name**|Specifies the name of the bank account that you select in the **Bank Account No.** field. This field is filled automatically.|  

 4. Choose the **OK** button.  

A direct-debit collection is added to the **Direct Debit Collections** page, and one or more direct-debit collection entries are created.  

### To export a direct-debit collection entry to a bank file  
 1. On the **Direct Debit Collections** page, choose the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** action.  
 2. On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that you want to export, and then choose the **Create Direct Debit File** action.  
 3. Save the export file to the location from where you send or upload it to your electronic bank.  

      On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, the **Direct Debit Collection Status** field is changed to File Created. On the **SEPA Direct Debit Mandates** page, the **Debit Counter** field is updated with one count.  

 If the exported file cannot be processed, for example because the customer is insolvent, you can reject the direct-debit collection entry. If the exported file is successfully processed by the bank, the due payments of the involved sales invoices are automatically collected from the involved customers. In that case you can close the collection.  

### To reject a direct-debit collection entry  

 * On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was not successfully processed, and then choose the **Reject Entry** action.  

      The value in the **Status** field on the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page is changed to **Rejected**.  

### To close a direct-debit collection  
 *  On the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page, select the entry that was successfully processed, and then choose the **Close Collection** action.  

      The related direct-debit collection is closed.  

 You can now proceed to post receipts of payment for the involved sales invoices. You can do this as you typically post payment receipts, such as on the **Payment Registration** page, or you can post the related payment receipts directly from the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. For more information, see [Collect Payments with SEPA Direct Debit](finance-collect-payments-with-sepa-direct-debit.md).

 You can post the payment receipt directly from the **Direct Debit Collections** page or the **Direct Debit Collect. Entries** page. Alternatively, you can relay the work to another user by preparing the related journal lines.
