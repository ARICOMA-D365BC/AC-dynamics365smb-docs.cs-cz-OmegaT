# Set Up and Publish KPI Web Services Based on Account Schedules
On the **Account Schedule KPI Web Service Setup** page, you set up how to show the account-schedule KPI data and which specific account schedules to base the KPIs on. When you choose the **Publish Web Service** button, the specified account-schedule KPI data is added to the list of published web services on the **Web Services** page.  

## To set up and publish a KPI web service that is based on account schedules  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Account Schedule KPI Web Service Setup**, and then choose the related link.

    Specify one or more account schedules that you want to publish as a KPI web service according to the setup that you made in the previous table.  

3.  On the **Account Schedules** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|

    |**Acc. Schedule Name**|Specify the account schedule that the KPI web service is based on.|  
    |**Acc. Schedule Description**|Specify the description of the account schedule that the KPI web service is based on.|  

4.  Repeat step 3 for all the account schedules that you want to base the account-schedule KPI web service on.  
5.  To view or edit the selected account schedule, on the **Account Schedule** FastTab, choose the **Edit Account Schedule** action.  
6.  To view the account-schedule KPI data that you have set up, choose the **Account Schedule KPI Web Service** action.
