# Switching to Another Company or Environment

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in many different countries and supports many different types of organizations. Your organization might set up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] so that you have to understand the terms *company* and *environment*.  

[!INCLUDE [company_environment](includes/company_environment.md)] For more information, see [Creating New Companies in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](about-new-company.md).  

> [!TIP]
> If you often switch between companies, or work with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from within another app like Microsoft Teams, it can be easy to lose track of where you are. To help you keeping track, you can add a badge that will display the company name, so you can quickly verify that you're in the right place. For more information, see [To display a company badge for quick access to company information](ui-change-basic-settings.md#badge).

Depending on your browser, you can also pin the different companies to your favourites bar.

## Switch to Another Environment

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the environments that you can access are available on the Office.com.  

1. Select the **App Launcher** icon ![App Launcher.](media/app-launcher-icon.png "The App Launcher provides access to more features").
2. If you don't see an app for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in the pane that opens, then choose **Office 365**. Then, enter **Business Central** in the **Search** box or select **All Apps** > **Business Apps**.  
3. There will be one [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app listed for each type of environment, like production and sandbox. To switch to another environment, choose the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for the type of environment it is. If there's more than one environment of a certain type, you'll then be asked to choose the environment to access.

## Switch to Another Company

When you're signed in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can quickly switch to another company. After you make the switch, the company you choose becomes your default company and will display the next time you sign in.

1. In the top-right corner, choose the **Settings** icon ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center"), and then choose the **My Settings** action.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also use the Alt+T keyboard shortcut to quickly open the My Settings page.

2. On the **My Settings** page, in the **Company** field, select the company.  
3. Choose the **OK** button.

> [!TIP]
> A good way to go directly to your default company when you sign in, and avoid having to specify an environment, is to add the the URL to your list of favorites after you sign in.
