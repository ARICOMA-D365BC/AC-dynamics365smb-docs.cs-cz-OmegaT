# Visit Our Video Library

You found our documentation. But some people prefer to watch content rather than read it. To that end, we're producing short, easily digestible videos. Most videos supplement our user assistance, and some of them can be viewed on their own.  

If you're new to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can launch the introduction videos from the welcome page that displays. If you're already working in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can get to the library from the **Business Manager** and **Accountant** Role Centers by choosing the **Product Videos** tile.  

You can also view our "how to" videos, plus much other content, on the YouTube playlist that we created for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To visit the videos now, [see here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851533).

> [!Tip]  
> Videos in the library display in a frame that might seem a little small. To make the frame larger, choose the double-ended arrow icon in the upper-right corner. Afterward, videos will display in the larger frame until you make it small again.
