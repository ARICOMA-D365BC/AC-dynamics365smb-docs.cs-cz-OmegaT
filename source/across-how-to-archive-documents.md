# Archive Documents
You can archive sales and purchase orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders, for example because you want to save a copy of a document for reuse later. You can archive a sales or purchase document several times, saving a different archived version each time.

For archived documents where the original still exists and is not posted, you can use the **Restore** function to overwrite the original with the archived version of the document. This is practical if you need to restore the contents of a document to an earlier state.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can only reuse the content by copying the data, for example with the **Copy from Document** function.   

## To set up automatic document archiving  
You can set up automatic archiving of sales and purchase orders, quotes, blanket orders, and return orders, before you delete documents.

The following procedure describes how to set up automatic archiving of sales documents. The steps are similar for purchase documents.
