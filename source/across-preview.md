# [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Trials and Subscriptions

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in an increasing number of countries across the world. If you want to learn about [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can sign up for a free trial. Then, when you are ready, you can talk to a reselling partner about getting a subscription.  

If you are not already working with a partner, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner).  

## Getting Started with a Trial

You can sign up for a free trial [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861). We recommend that you work with [a reselling partner](across-faq.md#findpartner) to help your organization get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

Depending on your country or region, the trial includes the languages and functionality that your country or region requires. For more information, see [Changing Language and Locale](about-locale-language.md).  

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], some things will be familiar to you, and other things might be unfamiliar. When you first sign in to the demonstration company, you get access to a Getting Started page with links to videos that can help you get started. For more information, see [Getting Started with [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)]](product-get-started.md).  

If you encounter difficulties, the [Frequently Asked Questions](across-faq.md) page can help you answer some of your questions. If you are unable to sign up for the trial, the [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md) page can help. You can also contact a [partner](across-faq.md#findpartner) and ask them to create a free trial or a different type of preview of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] for you.  

### Try Out Your Own Company

If you want to try out [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with your own data, you can switch to a free 30 day trial with an empty company. The **Set up my company** assisted setup guide can help you specify basic information about your business. Optionally, you can import data from your existing business management solution so that you can evaluate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with your own data. However, we recommend that you do not use a free trial to help run your business. Contact [a reselling partner](across-faq.md#findpartner) to learn more about how to get started with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

If 30 days are not enough for you to decide, you can extend your trial. For more information, see [Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?](admin-extend-trial.md).  

### Setting Up Your Company in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

To help you set up your company, the **Assisted Setup** page lists the assisted setup guides that can help you. Depending on your role and country or region, the page shows different assistant setup guides as illustrated in the following table:

### Resetting your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] trial experience

If you have added data to your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] free trial, and you want to start over with a fresh experience, you can create a new evaluation company and then delete the first company. Open the **Companies** page and choose **New** to start the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide. The guide can help you set up a fresh evaluation company with sample data. You can also create a copy of your current company, sign out, and then sign into your new company.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you share [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with other people from your organization, you must make sure other people are not logged in when you delete a company.  

## Getting Started with a Subscription

Each time you sign in during the trial period, a notification in a blue bar at the top displays the time remaining. If you decide to subscribe, find a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] partner. For more information, see [How do I find a reselling partner?](across-faq.md#findpartner). The reselling partner can help you set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to fit your business, including importing your data from your previous system. You can also customize [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by adding apps from [Microsoft AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2081646).  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online uses Microsoft 365. If your company uses a different type of email setup, the reselling partner can help you decided how to migrate, or if you should use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.  

You can also contact the [[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Sales team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707).  

## Getting Started with Sandboxes

Sandbox environments can be a way for you to practice with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Think of a sandbox as a non-production environment that you can use on top of your production instance of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For example, if you want to take the free online training from [Microsoft Learn](/learn/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs), your administrator can [create a sandbox environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-environments#create-a-sandbox-environment) so that you and your colleagues can practice there rather than in your production environment.  

If you are a developer, a sandbox lets you safely build and test extensions and develop new functionality to customize the service without affecting the data and settings of your production environment.  

Right now, all customers can use a sandbox, including organizations who have signed up for a trial. For more information about how to get started with a sandbox, see [Creating a Sandbox Environment](across-how-create-sandbox-environment.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Sandboxes created this way contain demonstration data for the fictitious CRONUS company. No data is copied or otherwise transferred from the production environment.  

The administrator of your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and your reselling partner can create additional environments in the administration center. For more information, see [The Business Central Administration Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center).
