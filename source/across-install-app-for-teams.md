[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

In this article, you learn how to install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams). The app is available on the Teams marketplace, and you can use it with the Teams web, desktop, or mobile app.

> [!NOTE]
> Your administrator may have set things up so that the app is automatically installed for you. To check whether the app is installed, open Teams, then choose **Apps**. Search for **Business Central**, then choose it when you find it. If you see **Open** on the **Business Central** page, the app is already installed.  

## Prerequisites

- A [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online user account is required for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams.

    If you’re not sure whether you have an account, or if you don’t know your credentials for signing in, contact your company administrator to help you get started.

- Access to the Teams desktop app or Teams in the browser. You can't install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using Teams mobile app.
