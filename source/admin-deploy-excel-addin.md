# Get the Business Central Add-in for Excel

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes an add-in for Excel that lets users select a **Edit in Excel** action on certain pages to open the data in an Excel worksheet. This action is different than the **Open in Excel** action because it lets users can make changes in Excel, then publish the changes back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

## Overview

### About the add-in

The add-in is called **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** and it's available for installation from on the [Office Store (AppSource)](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). With the add-in installed, the **Edit in Excel** action is available on most list and list part pages from the **Share** icon ![Share a page in another app.](media/share-icon.png). For more information about using the add-in, see [Viewing and Editing in Excel From Business Central](across-work-with-excel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The add-in works on Windows only; not macOS.

### About deployment as an admin

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, there are a few deployment options for getting the add-in to users. One option is *individual acquisition*, where you let users install the add-in themselves. With this option, users must have access to downloading files from the Office Store. Another option is to set up *Centralized Deployment* in the Microsoft 365 admin center to automatically deploy the add-in to your entire organization, groups, or specific users. Centralized Deployment provides a way to get the add-in to users if your organization doesn't give users access to the Office Store.

For the end-user, the installation experience is different for the two deployment scenarios:

- With individual acquisition, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the **New Office Add-in** pane opens in Excel. To install the add-in, the user chooses **Trust this add-in**, which in turn installs the add-in directly from the Office Store. Users then sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using their user name and password.

- With Centralized Deployment, the first time users choose the **Edit in Excel** action, the add-in is automatically installed in Excel from Centralized Deployment; not the Office Store. The only thing users have to do is sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

With both these deployment options, the add-in is automatically configured to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].A third deployment option is a manual installation of the add-in directly from Excel. With this option, users will need to configure the add-in to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

### <a name="switch"></a>Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment or the other way around

When you change from individual acquisition of the add-in to Centralized Deployment, or vice versa, Excel files that users created before the transition are affected. After the transition, users can still open any Excel worksheets previously created using the **Edit in Excel** action or created manually by configuring the Excel add-in. But they can't update the data in the file from Business Central or push updates to Business Central

This condition is caused by the fact that each Excel file gets assigned an "add-in" identifier. In the transition to or from Centralized Deployment, a different ID is assigned, so the earlier ID becomes blocked.

## Preparation (on-premises only)

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises requires that your environment is configured for the add-in. If not, the **Edit in Excel** action won't be available to users. For more information, see [Setting up the Excel Add-In for Editing Business Central Data](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-excel-addin) in the Developer and IT Pro help.

## Deploy the add-in by using Centralized Deployment

Centralized Deployment is a feature in Microsoft 365 admin center that you use to automatically install add-ins in users' Office apps, like Excel. To help you with Centralized Deployment, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup.

### Before you begin

- To learn about preventing users from downloading from the Office store, see [Manage add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).
- Verify that Centralized Deployment will work for your organization. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins)
- If you're transitioning from individual acquisition, see [Switching from individual acquisition to Centralized Deployment](#switch)

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Centralized Deployment affects features that use the Excel add-in, such as the **Edit in Excel** action. It has no effect on other Excel-related features and or permissions assigned to users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

### Set up Centralized Deployment of the add-in

You'll work in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment**, then choose the related link.
2. Read the information on the **Business Central Excel add-in setup** page and choose **Next**.
3. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2163967) and go to **Integrated Apps**<!--**Add-ins**-->.

    Complete the following steps to configure the add-in to deploy from the Office Store: 
    1. Choose **Get apps** to open Office Store (AppSource). <!--**Deploy Add-in** 5. In the **Deploy a new add-in**, select **Choose from the store**.-->
    2. Search for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in**, then select **Get it now**. <!--On the **Select add-in** page, search for and select **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-in** > **Add** > **Continue**.-->
    3. On the **Add Users** page, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for, then choose **Next**.<!--On the **Configure add-in**, specify the users that you want to deploy the add-in for.-->
    4. Review the **Accept permissions requests**, then choose **Next** > **Finish Deployment**.
    5. Wait for the green check mark next to **Deployed** appears for the add-in, then choose **Done**. <!--Select **Deploy** and wait til successful, then **Next** > **Continue**.-->

       The add-in appears on the **Add-ins** page. For more information about deploying add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).
4. Go back to **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and choose **Next**.
5. Turn on **Use Centralized Deployment**, and choose **Finish**.

    If you don't turn on this switch, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will get the add-in directly from the Office Store.

When finished, you can always change the deployment in Microsoft 365 admin center, like assigning more users. For more information about deploying add-ins in the admin center, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than one environment, you must run the **Excel Add-in Centralized Deployment** assisted setup on each environment that you want to use Centralized Deployment. However, you don't have to configure the Centralized Deployment in Microsoft 365 again. The only thing you have to do is turn on the **Use Centralized Deployment** switch in the assisted setup. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours before users the add-in deploys automatically in Excel of users.

## <a name="install"></a>Individual acquisition: Install the add-in manually for your own use

In most cases, when you open Excel from Business Central, the add-in will either be installed automatically for you or you'll be prompted to install it. There might be cases, however, where you have to manually install the add-in.

1. Open Excel, then open any Excel workbook.
2. On the **Insert** menu, choose **Add-ins** > **Get add-ins**
3. Go to **Admin managed** and look for **Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In**. If you see there, select it, then choose **Add**. If you don't see it, go to **Store**, then search for *Microsoft Dynamics Office Add-In* and follow the instruction on screen to add it.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, configure the connection.

### Configure the Business Central connection

If a user can't connect automatically, you can unblock them by asking them to follow these steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Dynamics** add-in pane in Excel, choose **Add server information**. If you don't see it, choose the ![More option button in Excel.](media/cogwheel.png) icon at the top to open the options dialog. 
2. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, set **Server URL** to `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`. For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, set it the URL of the web client, like `https://myBCserver/190`.
3. Choose **OK**, and then confirm that the app reloads.
4. When prompted, sign in with your Business Central user name and password.
5. Optionally, choose the environment and company that you want to connect to.

The add-in is now connected to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and you can edit data and publish the changes to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Prepare devices and network for the Excel Add-In

Network services such as proxies or firewalls must allow routing between each client device on which the add-In is installed and many service endpoints. For a list of endpoints, see [Preparing your network for the Excel Add-In](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/configuring-network-for-addins).

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, users run into problems with the Excel add-in. This section gives some tips for how to unblock users in certain circumstances.

|Problem  |Solution or workaround  |Comments  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|The add-in doesn't start|Check whether the add-in is deployed centrally. Or, check whether the user is blocked from installing it locally. | The admin can configure Office so that users can't acquire add-ins. In those cases, the admin must deploy the add-in centrally. For more information, see [Deploy add-ins in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).|
|Data doesn't load into Excel|Test the connection by opening another list in Excel from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Or, open the workbook in Excel in a browser.|If the user has specified a company name that contains special characters, the add-in can't connect. |
|Data can't publish back to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|Test the connection by opening the workbook in Excel in a browser. |Sometimes an extension can block the publishing job. If the page is extended or customized, remove the extensions, and then try again.|
|The dates are wrong  |Excel might show times and dates in a different format than [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This condition doesn't make them wrong, and the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] won't get messed up.|         |
|For some list pages, editing multiple lines in Excel consistently causes errors. This condition can occur if OData calls include FlowFields and fields outside of the repeater control.|On the **Web Services** page, select the **Exclude Non-Editable FlowFields** and **Exclude Fields Outside of the Repeater** check boxes for the published page. Selecting these check boxes excludes non-editable FlowFields and field from the eTag calculation. |These check boxes are hidden by default. To show them on the **Web Services** page, use [personalization](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user). |
|Users can no longer sign in to the add-in. When they try to sign in, the process stops without completing.| This problem might be caused by an update that we made to the add-in, sometime in July 2022. For more information and a fix, see [Modify the Excel Add-in Configuration to Support July 2022 Update](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/update-excel-addin-configuration).|Applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only|

## Deploy the Excel add-in for Business Central online

For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the administrator can deploy the add-in for all users. But users can also install the add-in themselves, provided they have permission to configure their Office experience.  

> [!TIP]
> In some organizations, administrators cannot deploy add-ins centrally. For more information, see [Determine if Centralized Deployment of add-ins works for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### To deploy the Excel add-in for all users

1. As the administrator, sign in to the Microsoft commercial website and find the add-in at [https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104379629).
2. Choose the **Get it now** button.

    You'll be redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
3. In the left panel, go to **Settings**, and then choose **Add-ins**.
4. In the **Configure add-in** pane, specify which users to grant access to the add-in.
5. Save your changes.


### To add the Excel add-in locally

1. Open Excel, and then open any Excel workbook.
2. On the **Insert** menu, choose **Office Add-ins**, and then choose **Admin managed** or **Store** as appropriate.
3. Search for *Dynamics Office Add-In*, and then install the add-in.

When the add-in is installed, it shows up as a panel in Excel. Next, you must configure the connection.

> [!TIP]
> If the workbook is not automatically saved to the user's OneDrive, then recommend them to save all workbooks that they export from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].When they open the workbook again, the connection is still available, so they do not have to configure the connection again.

> [!NOTE]
> In certain deployments, the administrator must configure network access to unblock the Excel add-in. For more information, see [Preparing Your Network for the Excel Add-In](configuring-network-for-addins.md).-->
