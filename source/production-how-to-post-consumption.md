# Batch Post Production Consumption
If the flushing method is **Manual**, you must post the components manually, using a consumption journal.

You can also set the system up to automatically post (*flush*) components when you start or finish production orders. For more information, see [Enable Flushing of Components According to Operation Output](production-how-to-flush-components-according-to-operation-output.md).

## To post consumption for one or more production order lines  
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Consumption Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Fill in the fields with the production order data and the consumption data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

    If the warehouse location where the components are stored is set up to use bins but does not require pick processing, assign a bin code to the journal line to indicate where the items should be taken from in the warehouse. For more information, see [Pick for Production or Assembly](warehouse-how-to-pick-for-production.md).  
3.  Choose the **Post** action to post the consumption. The related item ledger entries are reduced.
