# Sorry, this content is under construction

The video you tried to play isn't available right now. That's probably because we're updating the content.

We're constantly adding to and improving [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and sometimes our changes make an existing video inaccurate. To avoid confusion, we take down the content while we're working on the update.

Check back again soon though, and in the meantime you can explore other subjects on the [Dynamics 365 channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcakwueIHoT-wVFPKUtmxlqcG1kJ0oqq4).
