# Error message: "Posting Date is not within your range of allowed posting datesâ€¦"

When using the **Adjust Cost - Item Entries** batch job you may run into the following error message:

**Posting date is not within your range of allowed posting dates**

This error message indicates that the user is not allowed to post entries for the date in question, and this can be remedied by changing the user setup.

## Change the user setup  

|User ID  |Allow Posting From  | Allow Posting To  |
|---------|---------|--------|
|EUROPE  |  2020-09-11      |2020-09-30      |

The user in this case has an allowed posting date range from September 11th to September 30th and is therefore not allowed to post the Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th.

Assigning a wider allowed posting date range, as in Inventory Period or General Ledger Setup, makes it possible to avoid the conflict that causes the error message. The Adjustment Value Entry with Posting Date September 10th will be posted successfully with this setup.
