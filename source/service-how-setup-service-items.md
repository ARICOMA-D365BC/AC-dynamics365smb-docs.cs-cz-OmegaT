# Set Up Service Items and Service Item Components
To work with service items, you must set up the following

* Service item groups.
* Optional

## To set up service item groups
You can set up groups of items that are related in terms of repair and maintenance. You can define default values for service items in a service item group, such as response time, contract discount percent, and service price group. For items in a service item group, you can select whether you want them to be automatically registered as service items when they are sold.  

You assign service item groups to items on the **Item** card, and to service items on the **Service Item** card.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Item Groups**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Create a new service item group.  
3. Fill in the **Code** and **Description** fields.  
4. In the **Default Contract Discount %** field, enter the default contract discount percentage that you want the service items in the group to have.  
5. In the **Default Serv. Price Group Code** field, enter the default service price group code that you want the service items in the group to have.  
6. In the **Default Response Time (Hours)** field, enter the default response time in hours that you want the service items in the group to have.  
7. If you want to register the items in the group as service items when they are sold, select the **Create Service Item** field.  

## To set up service item components
A service item can consist of several components, which can be replaced with spare parts when the item is serviced. These components are set up on the **Service Item Component List** page. Additionally, if you want to set up components for service items that are BOMs, you can copy the BOM items and create them as service item components.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Add a new component.  
5. In the **Type** field, choose **Service Item** if the component itself is a registered service item. Otherwise, select **Item**.  
6. In the **No.** field, choose the item or service item that is a component of the service item.  

## To set up service item components from a BOM
1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Items**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the service item for which you want to set up components from a BOM.  
3. Choose the **Components** action. The **Service Item Component List** page opens.  
4. Choose the **Copy from BOM** action.  

    If the item that the service item is linked to is a BOM, the components for all the items in the BOM are created automatically.  

## To set up a service shelf
You can set up service shelves that identify where you store your service items. You assign service shelves to service items on the **Service Order** and **Service Item Worksheet** pages.  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Service Shelves**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary.
