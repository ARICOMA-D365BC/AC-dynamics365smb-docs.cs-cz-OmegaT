# Track Packages

A number of shipping agents provide services on the Internet that allow you to track parcels you have handed over to the agent. If you use one or more of these shipping agents, you can set up certain basic information and use the automatic tracking feature from posted shipments, posted sales invoices, posted sales credit memos, and posted return receipts. For more information, see [Set Up Shipping Agents](sales-how-to-set-up-shipping-agents.md).  

The following procedure shows how to track a package from a posted sales shipment, but the same steps apply to enable package tracking from the Posted Sales Invoice, Posted Sales Credit Memo, and Posted Return Receipt pages.  

## To track a package

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Shipment**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant shipment.
3. Choose the **Update Document** action.
4. In the **Package Tracking No.** field, enter the package number you have received from the shipping agent. Update **Shipping Agent** if needed and close the page.
5. Choose the **Track Package** action.

Your default browser opens the shipping agent's tracking page.
