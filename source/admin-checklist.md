# Onboard Users with Checklists

The first time a user signs into a new [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company, they can see a banner that encourages them to start the **Get started** checklist to help them set up key information and get ready for business. As the administrator or reselling partner, you can customize the predefined checklists, and you can set up your own steps.

## To add an item to the checklist

1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] at [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/).

2. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Checklist Administration**, and choose the related link.  

3. Choose the **New** action, and then choose **Create checklist item**.  

4. Specify what you want to add to the checklist. [!INCLUDE [tooltip-inline-tip_md](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

    > [!TIP]
    > If the step is for a setup guide, the **Task** field specifies the setup guide. If the step is for learning more, the **Task** field specifies the link to the article or e-learning module.
